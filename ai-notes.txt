AI talk:

Premise - let's talk about AI and how we should position it in GNOME and in the App Ecosystem. 

Background:
I run an AI Innovator programs where members of that program are training models, and solving problems using AI.  

What is AI exactly?

Series of algorithms that has a sophisticated way of matching patterns with a level of probabiliyt or confidence.
Using mathematical models, we can predict if something matches a pattern or not. 

Machine learning

You can teach an algorithm a pattern running them against a set of structured data. This data can come from a wide variety of 
sources. Sometimes it comes from analog sources that are converted to digital. Software that takes a soundwave and converts it 
to text - that process, is done through applied linguistics.
